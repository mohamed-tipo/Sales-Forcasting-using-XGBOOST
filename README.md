Sales Forecasting with XGBoost: Data Science Project
Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a predictive model using historical sales data to accurately forecast future sales. The process involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and applying regression algorithms. The model’s performance will be evaluated and optimized through hyperparameter tuning, to deliver actionable insights for businesses.
Problem Statement:
The objective is to build a regression model that predicts future sales based on historical data. Accurate sales forecasts will help businesses make strategic decisions in areas like inventory management, resource planning, and sales strategy optimization.
Solution Approach:
The approach involves using machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales patterns. The dataset will be preprocessed to address missing values and relevant features will be engineered. Various regression algorithms—including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Extra Trees, and advanced gradient boosting methods like XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM—will be applied to build the forecast model. Performance will be measured using appropriate evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter tuning will be performed to enhance accuracy.
Key Observations:
Exploratory data analysis reveals that sales exhibit seasonal trends and are influenced by factors such as marketing campaigns, product attributes, pricing, and broader economic conditions. Potential correlations between variables will be examined to improve model performance.
Dataset Description:
Below is a brief overview of the dataset columns:
- **Item Identifier**: Describes the type of item, allowing classification into categories such as food, beverages, and non-consumables.
- **Item Weight**: Indicates the product's net weight.
- **Item Fat Content**: Categorizes products into 'Low Fat' and 'Regular' based on fat content.
- **Item Visibility**: Measures how prominently an item is displayed in stores, influencing the likelihood of purchase.
- **Item Type**: Specifies item types such as bread, breakfast items, frozen foods, dairy products, and more.
- **Item MRP**: Denotes the Maximum Retail Price at which the product is sold.
- **Outlet Identifier**: Provides identifying information for each outlet.
- **Outlet Establishment Year**: The year the outlet was established.
- **Outlet Size**: Categorizes outlets by size: small, medium, and large.
- **Outlet Location Type**: Classifies the outlet location as Tier 1, Tier 2, or Tier 3.
- **Outlet Type**: Classifies outlets based on their structure, such as Grocery Store, Supermarket Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3.
- **Item Outlet Sales**: Represents the total sales value of an item in a specific outlet.
